As we approach the end of the Prototyping Sprint, you are required to complete the following technical mandates to qualify for evaluation.


1. Code Ownership & GitHub Handover

Before recording your presentation, you must transfer the ownership of your project repository for technical audit.
Action: Transfer or add the GitHub account ABharat108 as an owner/collaborator to your project repository.
Purpose: Our technical team will be reviewing the commit history and code quality to verify the "Algorithm of Execution."



2. Live Deployment (Hosting)

A prototype is only "functional" if it is accessible.
Mandate: Host your website/application on Vercel, Netlify, or any other free hosting platform.
Requirement: You must include the Live URL in your final submission. Broken links or "local-host only" projects will be automatically disqualified.


3. Video Presentation Standards

While recording your demonstration video (using the script provided shortly):
Visibility: All team members' faces must be clearly visible in the frame at the start and during their respective speaking parts.


Verification: This is a mandatory requirement to verify team participation and leadership roles.


4. Script Release
The official Video Script will be dropped in the group shortly. Do not start recording until you have reviewed the script structure, as it contains specific keywords required for the evaluation algorithm.
Execution is the only currency. Ensure your technical infrastructure is ready.
